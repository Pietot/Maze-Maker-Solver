Add a button to lock the screen so the maze don't reset on resize.
Move the start and end freely.
For mergValues function, take the selected cell with the most color in the maze.
Add a way to download the maze two different way: one by taking a screenshot of the div, another by converting the maze in a matrix (0 for wall, 1 for path, 2 for solution)
